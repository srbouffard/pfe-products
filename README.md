# PFE Products - Source of Truth

This repository serves as the central **source of truth** for all products owned by the Platform Engineering (PFE) team. It contains structured data files that define key information for each product, such as ownership, component lists, and relevant links.

The primary goal of this repository is to eliminate knowledge silos and provide a single, reliable reference point for everyone. The data is used to automatically generate and update documentation on our team Read the Docs site.

> This repo is WIP and exploratory ideas still to be refined further!


## ðŸ¤– The Automated Workflow

This repository uses a "docs-as-code" approach. The workflow is fully automated:

1.  **Update a Product**: A team member adds or updates a product's `product-name.yaml` file in the `/products` directory via a Pull Request.
2.  **Merge**: Once the PR is reviewed and merged, a GitHub Action is triggered.
3.  **Generate Docs**: The action uses templates to generate up-to-date documentation files (`.rst`).
4.  **Create a PR**: The action then automatically opens a Pull Request in our team with the new files.
5.  **Publish**: Once the documentation PR is approved and merged, the changes are published to our live docs site.
